One solution is to avoid nested percentage calculations within `calc()`.  Use absolute units like `px` or `rem` when possible.  If percentages are necessary, ensure that they are relative to a consistent and predictable container.  Consider using variables for frequently used values to improve readability and maintainability.

Another solution is to restructure the CSS to avoid reliance on nested `calc()` expressions entirely.  For instance, break down complex calculations into multiple simpler rules.

Example (avoiding nested percentages):

```css
.parent {
  width: 50%;
}

.child {
  width: 250px; /* Or use rem or other absolute unit */
  margin-left: 20px;
}
```

Example (avoiding mixed units):

```css
.parent {
  width: 50vw;
}

.child {
  width: 25vw; /* Use consistent unit */
  margin-left: 20px; /* Use consistent unit */
}
```

By carefully considering unit choices and simplifying calculations, these uncommon CSS `calc()` issues can be easily mitigated.
